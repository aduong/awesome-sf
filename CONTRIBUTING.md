# Pull Requests 101

This is an awesome list and it uses GitHub to manage contributions. That means you'll need to make a "Pull Request" if you want to improve the list.

For developers this should be mostly second nature. For others in tech, you might have made PRs before. For everyone else, we hope to put together a resource on how to make contributions. Regardless, the goal is to make contributions exceptionally easy and if need be, will put together a guide if we can't find an excellent resouce on the internet.

For now, we'll redirect you here: https://makeapullrequest.com/

# Contributing

Ready to make a PR? Please name your PR with the following convention:

```
[section] write a description starting with a verb
```

Example:

```
[organizations] add Noisebridge
```

Please keep your PRs short and focused. That means avoid adding many unrelated things at once.

Admins may do large changes where many things are done at once, but do not follow their example.
